# 1GRAM wallet
https://demo.hedgedoc.org/s/VNbakn3Dl

introducing our 1gram wallet https://one-gram.web.app/

The source code can be found https://github.com/defikitchen/1gram-app/

Works with standard TONOS stuff now, and we stand on the shoulders of giants, many thanks to TonLabs.

3 individuals primarily worked on this, with lots of advice from the community, and more is hoped for, but I guess I was the person who came up with the idea to leverage Vue on the stack to create it, so, 

Telegram handle that is shown on the original 'telegram winners' is:

@DW (now commonly known as dh2 or @hortonelectric).

I want to humbly ask that do not you take any misgivings about me personally to heart when judging this submission. I actually can't take credit for most of the work itself and I intend to share any rewards without too much regard for myself and rewarding mostly those who helped and believed in me instead.

It is the culmination of at least 1000 man-hours of combined work.  It's very extensible, has huge potential. 

We do note that React is the favored platform, we offer this as a VueJS alternative and hope to upgrade to Vue3 to make an even more pluggable system.

It does support easy and fully customizable network switching for fld, dev,mainnet.

Ability to have as many wallets /accounts as you want, and with ETH/BTC support planned, many other easier ways to interact with TON using different chains.

One highlight is that we use a preferred currency switcher, so everything is primarly displayed in the desired currency, example USD, EUR or Bitcoin, regardless of whether the wallet is a TON wallet or ETH wallet or whatever else.

Hidden (but almost complete) support for ETH and BTC wallets including full support for ERC20 tokens and the like.

Almost working support for Android/iOS and desktop.

Solid (and optional) BIP44 support. Import text private keys or mnemonics. Workchain -1 or 0 support.

More technical details:

Typescript/ESNext/Yarn

Vuetify, VueJS, webpack, cordova, electron

Continuous integration support with github. 

Goals for future support or things we have in the works over the next few months:

enhanced Developer-mode 'IDE' test suite for contract devs (free-form abstraction of contract mapping, low-code solution)

Potential collab to create an unofficial telegram client with TelegramV or other telegram contest winners in the 'Javascript contest'

Debot chat capability

Depool listing/join capability

Contest integration capability

ETH/BTC/ERC20

TON message decoding and encoding

Deeper block explorer integration

PWA support and ability to side-load PWA
